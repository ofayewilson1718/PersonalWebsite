        <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Vermont. I am a senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I am interested in software engineering, embedded systems, computer architecture, and most things computer science.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am currently looking for a job after I graduate in May 2023. My hopes are to work with a company that aligns with my own passions and values.</p>

      <p>I am extremely passionate about diversifying the computer science field. I graduated from an all-girls high school where I was surrounded by empowered women and lots of support. I wouldn't be pursuing this career if it weren't for the women who encouraged me to push myself and fight through all the challenges of being one of the only women in let alone my classes, but also the entire computer science field.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am additionally passionate about mental health and advancing the support available, as well as decreasing the stigma surrounding it.</p> 
      <br>
      <p>I've worked in a lot of teaching positions and most recently, I got the opportunity to work for Girls Who Code in their Summer Intensive Program. Girls Who Code was such a wonderful company to work for and I was so proud to be helping make education, specifically computer science education, more accessible for kids from all backgrounds!</p>
